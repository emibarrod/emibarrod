# This is me!!

I aim to be a Data Scientist, from performing data retrieval, data cleaning or data exploration to create AI models.

I studied Computer Science at [*Universidad de Sevilla*](https://www.us.es/) (from 2017 to 2021). In these college years I found the field of Data Science. More precisely, I found Data Science in an event called PyConEs, in 2019. There I met a lot of interesting professionals and a lot of different topics to dive on.

Since I started Computer Science I have made some projects by my own. One of the most interesting ones is the retrieval, analysis and forecasting over [REE](https://www.ree.es/es) data. You can found it [here](https://github.com/emibarrod/beca-investigacion-US).

The project that I am most proud of if [my TFG](https://github.com/emibarrod/TFG). I studied time series and tried to predict covid-19 by using LSTM and GRU networks.
